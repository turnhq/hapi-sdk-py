## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |

| `channel_id` | `float` | Required | - |
| `credentials` | `object` | Required | An object with credentials data |
| `facets` | `object` | Optional | An object with product parameters |
| `followed_instructions` | `bool` | Optional | When creating contracts for Channels that require the end-user to follow instructions (based on the `manual_setup_required` key in the response body for the [Retrieve details for channel with support for contracts](https://vonq.stoplight.io/docs/hapi/b3A6NTUxMjYwODI-retrieve-details-for-channel-with-support-for-contracts) endpoint), set this value to `true` to confirm the user has done so. For quality purposes, setting this field to `true` for Channels that don't require following instructions will result in a 400 Bad Request. |

| `credits` | `float` | Optional | - |
